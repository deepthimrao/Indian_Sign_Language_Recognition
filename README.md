# Indian Sign Language Recognition
Problem Statement 
Sign Language has been a very important source of communication among deaf people throughout 
history. It is a type of communication that is conveyed through a mixture of gestures performed by 
our hand, head and body. Now with the advent of various technologies like sensors, machine learning, 
computer vision, communication for deaf people has become easier where there can communicate 
with people who do not know the sign language and the technology helps in the translation of the 
language. There are many different types of sign languages that have been evolved throughout the 
world. We will be focusing our project on Indian Sign Language (ISL). 

ISL uses a combination of both hands to convey the letters of the English alphabet from A to Z. Our 
project aims to build a machine learning algorithm that recognizes and classifies the Indian Sign 
Language visually from static images showing various hand gestures representing the English alphabet 
and numbers with the help of various ML algorithms.

### Data Source 
The data consists of 1200 images per letter of the alphabet of size 128ùë•128. It consists of cropped 
images of hands showing the sign for each letter. This data was captured ensuring constant 
illumination in the background
